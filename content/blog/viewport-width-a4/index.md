This is goind to be a very practical, simple and hopefully useful post.

It comes from an issue I gaced last week.

I wanted to display some content on the screen, only if the viewport width was above the width size of an A4 paper. The reason for doing this, is that I wanted the content of my site to be renderable as a pdf.

In order to do so, I obviously used breakpoints, but the question is, what is the right width size in pixels, so that content only shows on the A4 paper size and not below?

Well the answer is simple and straightforward, it should be above 540 pixels. You should make sure that your content appears above this breakpoint in order to ensure displaying it in a A4 version of your site.

Hope this saves you searching time and some trial and error.

Till next time.

V.
